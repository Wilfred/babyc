# Babyc

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Wilfred/babyc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Wilfred/babyc)

An educational foray into compiler writing. Written in C, compiling C
to x86 assembly
([handy x86 reference site](http://x86.renejeschke.de/),
[assembly directives reference](https://www.sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.12/as.info/Pseudo-Ops.html),
[System V ABI reference](http://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-i386.pdf)).

Technically targeting C11
([standard PDF](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf)),
but we will implement such a small subset of C that it's academic.

## Current feature set

* positive integers (no other types yet)
* integer constants
* logical negation (`!FOO`)
* bitwise negation (`~FOO`)
* addition (`foo + bar`)
* subtraction (`foo - bar` binary only)
* multiplication (`foo * bar`)
* less than comparison (`foo < bar`, `foo <= bar`)
* comments (`// foo` and `/* foo */`)
* sequences of statements (`foo; bar`)
* return statements
* if statements (`if (foo) { bar }`, no `else` yet)
* local variables (`int` only, function scope only, must be
  initialised)
* variable assignment (`int` only)
* while loops (`while (foo) { bar }`)
* function calls (only `int foo()` i.e. no arguments, returning int)
* preprocessor usage (we shell out to gcc)

## Usage

You will need `clang`, `lex` and `yacc` installed. GNU Bison is known
to work, other yacc implementations may not.

Compiling babyc:

    # Compile the compiler.
    $ make

Usage:

    # Run it, producing an assembly file.
    $ build/babyc test_programs/immediate__return_1.c
    # Use the GNU toolchain to assemble and link.
    $ ./link

Viewing the code after preprocessing:

    $ build/babyc --dump-expansion test_programs/if_false__return_2.c

Viewing the AST:

    $ build/babyc --dump-ast test_programs/if_false__return_2.c

Running tests:

    $ make test

### Debugging

If you're debugging a compiled program that segfaults, you may want to
simply read the out.s file.

To use gdb (given we have no signal table, function prologues or other
conveniences), do the following:

    $ gdb out
    (gdb) run
    ... it segfaults
    (gdb) layout asm
    ... shows which line the segfault occurred on
    (gdb) info registers
    ... shows the current state of the registers (`layout reg' also
    ... provides this data)

If you want to debug a program that doesn't segfault, you can set a
breakpoint to the entrypoint:

    $ gdb out
    (gdb) info files
        ...
        Entry point: 0x80000000
        ...
    (gdb) break *0x80000000
    (gdb) run

## Improving code quality

The make command will generate warnings, fix them. You can also run
with clang-analyzer to catch further issues:

    $ scan-build make

For code formatting, run:

    $ make format
